Introduction\\nDeep neural networks contain multiple non-linear hidden layers and this makes them very\\nexpressive models that can learn very complicated relationships between their inputs and\\noutputs. With limited training data, however, many of these complicated relationships\\nwill be the result of sampling noise, so they will exist in the training set but not in real\\ntest data even if it is drawn from the same distribution. This leads to overﬁtting and many\\nmethods have been developed for reducing it. These include stopping the training as soon as\\nperformance on a validation set starts to get worse, introducing weight penalties of various\\nkinds such as L1 and L2 regularization and soft weight sharing (Nowlan and Hinton, 1992).\\nWith unlimited computation, the best way to “regularize” a ﬁxed-sized model is to\\naverage the predictions of all possible settings of the parameters, weighting each setting by\\nc⃝2014 Nitish Srivastava, Geoﬀrey Hinton, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever and Ruslan Salakhutdinov.', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Dropout_Official-paper.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",

We propose to do this by approximating an equally weighted geometric\\nmean of the predictions of an exponential number of learned models that share parameters.\\nModel combination nearly always improves the performance of machine learning meth-\\nods. With large neural networks, however, the obvious idea of averaging the outputs of\\nmany separately trained nets is prohibitively expensive. Combining several models is most\\nhelpful when the individual models are diﬀerent from each other and in order to make\\nneural net models diﬀerent, they should either have diﬀerent architectures or be trained\\non diﬀerent data. Training many diﬀerent architectures is hard because ﬁnding optimal\\nhyperparameters for each architecture is a daunting task and training each large network\\nrequires a lot of computation.

It prevents overﬁtting and\\nprovides a way of approximately combining exponentially many diﬀerent neural network\\narchitectures eﬃciently. The term “dropout” refers to dropping out units (hidden and\\nvisible) in a neural network. By dropping a unit out, we mean temporarily removing it from\\nthe network, along with all its incoming and outgoing connections, as shown in Figure 1.\\nThe choice of which units to drop is random.

The thinned network consists of all the units that survived dropout (Figure 1b). A\\nneural net with nunits, can be seen as a collection of 2npossible thinned neural networks.\\nThese networks all share weights so that the total number of parameters is still O(n2), or\\nless.

The weights\\nof this network are scaled-down versions of the trained weights. If a unit is retained with\\nprobability pduring training, the outgoing weights of that unit are multiplied by pat test\\ntime as shown in Figure 2. This ensures that for any hidden unit the expected output (under\\nthe distribution used to drop units at training time) is the same as the actual output at\\ntest time.

This includes a detailed analysis of the practical considerations\\ninvolved in choosing hyperparameters when training dropout networks.\\n2. Motivation\\nA motivation for dropout comes from a theory of the role of sex in evolution (Livnat et al.,\\n2010). Sexual reproduction involves taking half the genes of one parent and half of the\\nother, adding a very small amount of random mutation, and combining them to produce an\\noﬀspring. The asexual alternative is to create an oﬀspring with a slightly mutated copy of\\nthe parent’s genes. It seems plausible that asexual reproduction should be a better way to\\noptimize individual ﬁtness because a good set of genes that have come to work well together\\ncan be passed on directly to the oﬀspring. On the other hand, sexual reproduction is likely\\nto break up these co-adapted sets of genes, especially if these sets are large and, intuitively,\\nthis should decrease the ﬁtness of organisms that have already evolved complicated co-\\nadaptations. However, sexual reproduction is the way most advanced organisms evolved.\\nOne possible explanation for the superiority of sexual reproduction is that, over the long\\nterm, the criterion for natural selection may not be individual ﬁtness but rather mix-ability\\nof genes. The ability of a set of genes to be able to work well with another random set of\\ngenes makes them more robust. Since a gene cannot rely on a large set of partners to be\\npresent at all times, it must learn to do something useful on its own or in collaboration with\\nasmall number of other genes. According to this theory, the role of sexual reproduction\\nis not just to allow useful new genes to spread throughout the population, but also to\\nfacilitate this process by reducing complex co-adaptations that would reduce the chance of\\na new gene improving the ﬁtness of an individual. Similarly, each hidden unit in a neural\\nnetwork trained with dropout must learn to work with a randomly chosen sample of other\\nunits. This should make each hidden unit more robust and drive it towards creating useful\\nfeatures on its own without relying on other hidden units to correct its mistakes. However,\\nthe hidden units within a layer will still learn to do diﬀerent things from each other. One\\nmight imagine that the net would become robust against dropout by making many copies\\nof each hidden unit, but this is a poor solution for exactly the same reason as replica codes\\nare a poor way to deal with a noisy channel.\\nA closely related, but slightly diﬀerent motivation for dropout comes from thinking\\nabout successful conspiracies. Ten conspiracies each involving ﬁve people is probably a\\nbetter way to create havoc than one big conspiracy that requires ﬁfty people to all play\\ntheir parts correctly. If conditions do not change and there is plenty of time for rehearsal, a\\nbig conspiracy can work well, but with non-stationary conditions, the smaller the conspiracy\\nthe greater its chance of still working. Complex co-adaptations can be trained to work well\\non a training set, but on novel test data they are far more likely to fail than multiple simpler\\nco-adaptations that achieve the same thing.\\n3. Related Work\\nDropout can be interpreted as a way of regularizing a neural network by adding noise to\\nits hidden units. The idea of adding noise to the states of units has previously been used in\\nthe context of Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) by Vincent et al. (2008, 2010) where noise\\n1932', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Dropout_Official-paper.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Dropout\\nis added to the input units of an autoencoder and the network is trained to reconstruct the\\nnoise-free input. Our work extends this idea by showing that dropout can be eﬀectively\\napplied in the hidden layers as well and that it can be interpreted as a form of model\\naveraging. We also show that adding noise is not only useful for unsupervised feature\\nlearning but can also be extended to supervised learning problems. In fact, our method can\\nbe applied to other neuron-based architectures, for example, Boltzmann Machines. While\\n5% noise typically works best for DAEs, we found that our weight scaling procedure applied\\nat test time enables us to use much higher noise levels. Dropping out 20% of the input units\\nand 50% of the hidden units was often found to be optimal.\\nSince dropout can be seen as a stochastic regularization technique, it is natural to\\nconsider its deterministic counterpart which is obtained by marginalizing out the noise. In\\nthis paper, we show that, in simple cases, dropout can be analytically marginalized out\\nto obtain deterministic regularization methods. Recently, van der Maaten et al. (2013)\\nalso explored deterministic regularizers corresponding to diﬀerent exponential-family noise\\ndistributions, including dropout (which they refer to as “blankout noise”). However, they\\napply noise to the inputs and only explore models with no hidden layers. Wang and Manning\\n(2013) proposed a method for speeding up dropout by marginalizing dropout noise. Chen\\net al. (2012) explored marginalization in the context of denoising autoencoders.\\nIn dropout, we minimize the loss function stochastically under a noise distribution.\\nThis can be seen as minimizing an expected loss function. Previous work of Globerson and\\nRoweis (2006); Dekel et al. (2010) explored an alternate setting where the loss is minimized\\nwhen an adversary gets to pick which units to drop. Here, instead of a noise distribution,\\nthe maximum number of units that can be dropped is ﬁxed. However, this work also does\\nnot explore models with hidden units.\\n4. Model Description\\nThis section describes the dropout neural network model. Consider a neural network with\\nLhidden layers. Let l∈{1,...,L}index the hidden layers of the network. Let z(l)denote\\nthe vector of inputs into layer l,y(l)denote the vector of outputs from layer l(y(0)=xis\\nthe input). W(l)andb(l)are the weights and biases at layer l.

This vector is\\nsampled and multiplied element-wise with the outputs of that layer, y(l), to create the\\nthinned outputs ˜y(l). The thinned outputs are then used as input to the next layer. This\\nprocess is applied at each layer. This amounts to sampling a sub-network from a larger\\nnetwork. For learning, the derivatives of the loss function are backpropagated through the\\nsub-network. At test time, the weights are scaled as W(l)\\ntest=pW(l)as shown in Figure 2.\\nThe resulting neural network is used without dropout.\\n5. Learning Dropout Nets\\nThis section describes a procedure for training dropout neural nets.\\n5.1 Backpropagation\\nDropout neural networks can be trained using stochastic gradient descent in a manner simi-\\nlar to standard neural nets. The only diﬀerence is that for each training case in a mini-batch,\\nwe sample a thinned network by dropping out units. Forward and backpropagation for that\\ntraining case are done only on this thinned network. The gradients for each parameter are\\naveraged over the training cases in each mini-batch. Any training case which does not use a\\nparameter contributes a gradient of zero for that parameter. Many methods have been used\\nto improve stochastic gradient descent such as momentum, annealed learning rates and L2\\nweight decay. Those were found to be useful for dropout neural networks as well.\\nOne particular form of regularization was found to be especially useful for dropout—\\nconstraining the norm of the incoming weight vector at each hidden unit to be upper\\nbounded by a ﬁxed constant c. In other words, if wrepresents the vector of weights incident\\non any hidden unit, the neural network was optimized under the constraint ||w||2≤c. This\\nconstraint was imposed during optimization by projecting wonto the surface of a ball of\\nradiusc, whenever wwent out of it. This is also called max-norm regularization since it\\nimplies that the maximum value that the norm of any weight can take is c. The constant\\n1934', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Dropout_Official-paper.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

Max-norm\\nregularization has been previously used in the context of collaborative ﬁltering (Srebro and\\nShraibman, 2005). It typically improves the performance of stochastic gradient descent\\ntraining of deep neural nets, even when no dropout is used.\\nAlthough dropout alone gives signiﬁcant improvements, using dropout along with max-\\nnorm regularization, large decaying learning rates and high momentum provides a signiﬁcant\\nboost over just using dropout. A possible justiﬁcation is that constraining weight vectors\\nto lie inside a ball of ﬁxed radius makes it possible to use a huge learning rate without the\\npossibility of weights blowing up. The noise provided by dropout then allows the optimiza-\\ntion process to explore diﬀerent regions of the weight space that would have otherwise been\\ndiﬃcult to reach. As the learning rate decays, the optimization takes shorter steps, thereby\\ndoing less exploration and eventually settles into a minimum.\\n5.2 Unsupervised Pretraining\\nNeural networks can be pretrained using stacks of RBMs (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006),\\nautoencoders (Vincent et al., 2010) or Deep Boltzmann Machines (Salakhutdinov and Hin-\\nton, 2009). Pretraining is an eﬀective way of making use of unlabeled data. Pretraining\\nfollowed by ﬁnetuning with backpropagation has been shown to give signiﬁcant performance\\nboosts over ﬁnetuning from random initializations in certain cases.\\nDropout can be applied to ﬁnetune nets that have been pretrained using these tech-\\nniques. The pretraining procedure stays the same. The weights obtained from pretraining\\nshould be scaled up by a factor of 1 /p. This makes sure that for each unit, the expected\\noutput from it under random dropout will be the same as the output during pretraining.\\nWe were initially concerned that the stochastic nature of dropout might wipe out the in-\\nformation in the pretrained weights. This did happen when the learning rates used during\\nﬁnetuning were comparable to the best learning rates for randomly initialized nets. How-\\never, when the learning rates were chosen to be smaller, the information in the pretrained\\nweights seemed to be retained and we were able to get improvements in terms of the ﬁnal\\ngeneralization error compared to not using dropout when ﬁnetuning.\\n6. Experimental Results\\nWe trained dropout neural networks for classiﬁcation problems on data sets in diﬀerent\\ndomains. We found that dropout improved generalization performance on alldata sets\\ncompared to neural networks that did not use dropout. Table 1 gives a brief description of\\nthe data sets.

The\\ntask is to take a bag of words representation of a document and classify it into 50 disjoint\\ntopics. Appendix B.5 describes the setup in more detail. Our best neural net which did\\nnot use dropout obtained an error rate of 31 .05%. Adding dropout reduced the error to\\n29.62%. We found that the improvement was much smaller compared to that for the vision\\nand speech data sets.\\n6.4 Comparison with Bayesian Neural Networks\\nDropout can be seen as a way of doing an equally-weighted averaging of exponentially many\\nmodels with shared weights. On the other hand, Bayesian neural networks (Neal, 1996) are\\nthe proper way of doing model averaging over the space of neural network structures and\\nparameters. In dropout, each model is weighted equally, whereas in a Bayesian neural\\nnetwork each model is weighted taking into account the prior and how well the model ﬁts\\nthe data, which is the more correct approach. Bayesian neural nets are extremely useful for\\nsolving problems in domains where data is scarce such as medical diagnosis, genetics, drug\\ndiscovery and other computational biology applications. However, Bayesian neural nets are\\nslow to train and diﬃcult to scale to very large network sizes. Besides, it is expensive to\\nget predictions from many large nets at test time. On the other hand, dropout neural nets\\nare much faster to train and use at test time. In this section, we report experiments that\\ncompare Bayesian neural nets with dropout neural nets on a small data set where Bayesian\\nneural networks are known to perform well and obtain state-of-the-art results. The aim is\\nto analyze how much does dropout lose compared to Bayesian neural nets.\\nThe data set that we use (Xiong et al., 2011) comes from the domain of genetics.

Xiong et al.\\n(2011) used Bayesian neural nets for this task. As expected, we found that Bayesian neural\\nnets perform better than dropout. However, we see that dropout improves signiﬁcantly\\nupon the performance of standard neural nets and outperforms all other methods. The\\nchallenge in this data set is to prevent overﬁtting since the size of the training set is small.\\nOne way to prevent overﬁtting is to reduce the input dimensionality using PCA. Thereafter,\\nstandard techniques such as SVMs or logistic regression can be used. However, with dropout\\nwe were able to prevent overﬁtting without the need to do dimensionality reduction. The\\ndropout nets are very large (1000s of hidden units) compared to a few tens of units in the\\nBayesian network. This shows that dropout has a strong regularizing eﬀect.\\n6.5 Comparison with Standard Regularizers\\nSeveral regularization methods have been proposed for preventing overﬁtting in neural net-\\nworks. These include L2 weight decay (more generally Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov,\\n1943)), lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), KL-sparsity and max-norm regularization. Dropout can\\nbe seen as another way of regularizing neural networks. In this section we compare dropout\\nwith some of these regularization methods using the MNIST data set.\\nThe same network architecture (784-1024-1024-2048-10) with ReLUs was trained us-\\ning stochastic gradient descent with diﬀerent regularizations. Table 9 shows the results.\\nThe values of diﬀerent hyperparameters associated with each kind of regularization (decay\\nconstants, target sparsity, dropout rate, max-norm upper bound) were obtained using a\\nvalidation set. We found that dropout combined with max-norm regularization gives the\\nlowest generalization error.\\n7.

In this section, we closely examine\\nhow dropout aﬀects a neural network. We analyze the eﬀect of dropout on the quality of\\nfeatures produced.

This in turn leads to overﬁtting because these\\nco-adaptations do not generalize to unseen data. We hypothesize that for each hidden unit,\\ndropout prevents co-adaptation by making the presence of other hidden units unreliable.\\nTherefore, a hidden unit cannot rely on other speciﬁc units to correct its mistakes. It must\\nperform well in a wide variety of diﬀerent contexts provided by the other hidden units.

However, it is apparent that the features\\nshown in Figure 7a have co-adapted in order to produce good reconstructions.

On the other hand, in\\nFigure 7b, the hidden units seem to detect edges, strokes and spots in diﬀerent parts of the\\nimage.

Figure 8a and Figure 8b compare the sparsity for\\nthe two models. In a good sparse model, there should only be a few highly activated units\\nfor any data case.

Dropout Restricted Boltzmann Machines\\nBesides feed-forward neural networks, dropout can also be applied to Restricted Boltzmann\\nMachines (RBM).

Each random variable rjtakes the value 1 with probability p, independent of\\nothers. Ifrjtakes the value 1, the hidden unit hjis retained, otherwise it is dropped from\\nthe model. The joint distribution deﬁned by a Dropout RBM can be expressed as\\nP(r,h,v;p,θ) =P(r;p)P(h,v|r;θ),\\nP(r;p) =F∏\\nj=1prj(1−p)1−rj,\\nP(h,v|r;θ) =1\\nZ′(θ,r)exp(v⊤Wh+a⊤h+b⊤v)F∏\\nj=1g(hj,rj),\\ng(hj,rj) = 1(rj= 1) + 1(rj= 0) 1(hj= 0).\\nZ′(θ,r) is the normalization constant. g(hj,rj) imposes the constraint that if rj= 0,\\nhjmust be 0.

Marginalizing Dropout\\nDropout can be seen as a way of adding noise to the states of hidden units in a neural\\nnetwork. In this section, we explore the class of models that arise as a result of marginalizing\\nthis noise. These models can be seen as deterministic versions of dropout. In contrast to\\nstandard (“Monte-Carlo”) dropout, these models do not need random bits and it is possible\\nto get gradients for the marginalized loss functions. In this section, we brieﬂy explore these\\nmodels.\\nDeterministic algorithms have been proposed that try to learn models that are robust to\\nfeature deletion at test time (Globerson and Roweis, 2006). Marginalization in the context\\nof denoising autoencoders has been explored previously (Chen et al., 2012). The marginal-\\nization of dropout noise in the context of linear regression was discussed in Srivastava (2013).\\nWang and Manning (2013) further explored the idea of marginalizing dropout to speed-up\\ntraining. van der Maaten et al.

(2013) describes how\\ndropout can be seen as an adaptive regularizer.\\n9.1 Linear Regression\\nFirst we explore a very simple case of applying dropout to the classical problem of linear\\nregression. Let X∈RN×Dbe a data matrix of Ndata points. y∈RNbe a vector of\\ntargets. Linear regression tries to ﬁnd a w∈RDthat minimizes\\n||y−Xw||2.\\nWhen the input Xis dropped out such that any input dimension is retained with\\nprobability p, the input can be expressed as R∗XwhereR∈{0,1}N×Dis a random matrix\\nwithRij∼Bernoulli(p) and∗denotes an element-wise product. Marginalizing the noise,\\nthe objective function becomes\\nminimize\\nwER∼Bernoulli(p)[\\n||y−(R∗X)w||2]\\n.\\nThis reduces to\\nminimize\\nw||y−pXw||2+p(1−p)||Γw||2,\\nwhere Γ = (diag( X⊤X))1/2. Therefore, dropout with linear regression is equivalent, in\\nexpectation, to ridge regression with a particular form for Γ. This form of Γ essentially\\nscales the weight cost for weight wiby the standard deviation of the ith dimension of the\\ndata. If a particular data dimension varies a lot, the regularizer tries to squeeze its weight\\nmore.\\nAnother interesting way to look at this objective is to absorb the factor of pintow.\\nThis leads to the following form\\nminimize\\nw||y−X˜w||2+1−p\\np||Γ˜w||2,\\nwhere˜w=pw. This makes the dependence of the regularization constant on pexplicit.\\nForpclose to 1, all the inputs are retained and the regularization constant is small. As\\nmore dropout is done (by decreasing p), the regularization constant grows larger.\\n9.2 Logistic Regression and Deep Networks\\nFor logistic regression and deep neural nets, it is hard to obtain a closed form marginalized\\nmodel. However, Wang and Manning (2013) showed that in the context of dropout applied\\nto logistic regression, the corresponding marginalized model can be trained approximately.\\nUnder reasonable assumptions, the distributions over the inputs to the logistic unit and over\\nthe gradients of the marginalized model are Gaussian. Their means and variances can be\\ncomputed eﬃciently. This approximate marginalization outperforms Monte-Carlo dropout\\nin terms of training time and generalization performance.\\nHowever, the assumptions involved in this technique become successively weaker as more\\nlayers are added. Therefore, the results are not directly applicable to deep networks.\\n1950', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Dropout_Official-paper.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n",

Multiplicative Gaussian Noise\\nDropout involves multiplying hidden activations by Bernoulli distributed random variables\\nwhich take the value 1 with probability pand 0 otherwise. This idea can be generalized\\nby multiplying the activations with random variables drawn from other distributions. We\\nrecently discovered that multiplying by a random variable drawn from N(1,1) works just\\nas well, or perhaps better than using Bernoulli noise. This new form of dropout amounts\\nto adding a Gaussian distributed random variable with zero mean and standard deviation\\nequal to the activation of the unit. That is, each hidden activation hiis perturbed to\\nhi+hirwherer∼N (0,1), or equivalently hir′wherer′∼N (1,1). We can generalize\\nthis tor′∼N (1,σ2) whereσbecomes an additional hyperparameter to tune, just like p\\nwas in the standard (Bernoulli) dropout. The expected value of the activations remains\\nunchanged, therefore no weight scaling is required at test time.\\nIn this paper, we described dropout as a method where we retain units with probability p\\nat training time and scale down the weights by multiplying them by a factor of pat test time.\\nAnother way to achieve the same eﬀect is to scale up the retained activations by multiplying\\nby 1/pat training time and not modifying the weights at test time. These methods are\\nequivalent with appropriate scaling of the learning rate and weight initializations at each\\nlayer.\\nTherefore, dropout can be seen as multiplying hiby a Bernoulli random variable rbthat\\ntakes the value 1 /pwith probability pand 0 otherwise. E[rb] = 1 andVar[rb] = (1−p)/p.\\nFor the Gaussian multiplicative noise, if we set σ2= (1−p)/p, we end up multiplying\\nhiby a random variable rg, whereE[rg] = 1 andVar[rg] = (1−p)/p. Therefore, both\\nforms of dropout can be set up so that the random variable being multiplied by has the\\nsame mean and variance. However, given these ﬁrst and second order moments, rghas the\\nhighest entropy and rbhas the lowest.

This suggests that dropout is a general technique\\nand is not speciﬁc to any domain. Methods that use dropout achieve state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on SVHN, ImageNet, CIFAR-100 and MNIST. Dropout considerably improved the\\nperformance of standard neural nets on other data sets as well.\\nThis idea can be extended to Restricted Boltzmann Machines and other graphical mod-\\nels. The central idea of dropout is to take a large model that overﬁts easily and repeatedly\\nsample and train smaller sub-models from it. RBMs easily ﬁt into this framework. We de-\\nveloped Dropout RBMs and empirically showed that they have certain desirable properties.\\nOne of the drawbacks of dropout is that it increases training time. A dropout network\\ntypically takes 2-3 times longer to train than a standard neural network of the same ar-\\nchitecture. A major cause of this increase is that the parameter updates are very noisy.\\nEach training case eﬀectively tries to train a diﬀerent random architecture. Therefore, the\\ngradients that are being computed are not gradients of the ﬁnal architecture that will be\\nused at test time. Therefore, it is not surprising that training takes a long time. However,\\nit is likely that this stochasticity prevents overﬁtting. This creates a trade-oﬀ between over-\\nﬁtting and training time. With more training time, one can use high dropout and suﬀer less\\noverﬁtting. However, one way to obtain some of the beneﬁts of dropout without stochas-\\nticity is to marginalize the noise to obtain a regularizer that does the same thing as the\\ndropout procedure, in expectation. We showed that for linear regression this regularizer is\\na modiﬁed form of L2 regularization. For more complicated models, it is not obvious how to\\nobtain an equivalent regularizer.

A Practical Guide for Training Dropout Networks\\nNeural networks are infamous for requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. Dropout\\nnetworks are no exception. In this section, we describe heuristics that might be useful for\\napplying dropout.\\nA.1 Network Size\\nIt is to be expected that dropping units will reduce the capacity of a neural network. If\\nnis the number of hidden units in any layer and pis the probability of retaining a unit,\\nthen instead of nhidden units, only pnunits will be present after dropout, in expectation.\\nMoreover, this set of pnunits will be diﬀerent each time and the units are not allowed to\\nbuild co-adaptations freely. Therefore, if an n-sized layer is optimal for a standard neural\\nnet on any given task, a good dropout net should have at least n/punits. We found this to\\nbe a useful heuristic for setting the number of hidden units in both convolutional and fully\\nconnected networks.\\n1952', metadata={'source': 'pdfs\\\\Dropout_Official-paper.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

Therefore, a lot of gradients tend to cancel each other. In\\norder to make up for this, a dropout net should typically use 10-100 times the learning rate\\nthat was optimal for a standard neural net. Another way to reduce the eﬀect the noise is\\nto use a high momentum. While momentum values of 0.9 are common for standard nets,\\nwith dropout we found that values around 0.95 to 0.99 work quite a lot better. Using high\\nlearning rate and/or momentum signiﬁcantly speed up learning.\\nA.3 Max-norm Regularization\\nThough large momentum and learning rate speed up learning, they sometimes cause the\\nnetwork weights to grow very large. To prevent this, we can use max-norm regularization.\\nThis constrains the norm of the vector of incoming weights at each hidden unit to be bound\\nby a constant c. Typical values of crange from 3 to 4.\\nA.4 Dropout Rate\\nDropout introduces an extra hyperparameter—the probability of retaining a unit p. This\\nhyperparameter controls the intensity of dropout. p= 1, implies no dropout and low values\\nofpmean more dropout. Typical values of pfor hidden units are in the range 0 .5 to 0.8.\\nFor input layers, the choice depends on the kind of input. For real-valued inputs (image\\npatches or speech frames), a typical value is 0 .8. For hidden layers, the choice of pis coupled\\nwith the choice of number of hidden units n.
